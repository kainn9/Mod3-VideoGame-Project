# Quick Heads Up!
So, here's the deal: This project is a relic from my early days in a coding bootcamp. I've got to admit, I was pretty clueless back then. To be honest, I'm not 100% convinced much has changedâ€”I'm still figuring things out. But let me tell you, my coding skills have come a long way since this.

## Brief Summary: 
Flappy Bird is a web game/app designed in 1 week by Vlad(https://github.com/Vnapuri) and I! Our goal was to make a game that allowed users to fight for the top ranking by farming enemies for various item drops. Users can get lucky and get power up drops! Users can also click on items in their inventory to get more detailed information about them. Users can also sell their regular items to save enough currency(yennies) to buy power ups from the shop as well. The strongest enemies are at the top of the map. When the player enters the level a survial timer starts. If the player survives the duration of the timer they will be teleported back to the shop to sell their loot. However, if the user is defeated too early they will lose all their loot and lose the chance to sell for rankings/currency. This includes power up items. The level/mob placement is randomized unless the player re-enters after using an escape scroll. Under those circumstances the level retains its previous state.
